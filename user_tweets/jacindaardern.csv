Sat Jun 13 09:40:09 +0000 2020,@grantrobertson1 I think you’re forgetting who chairs the meeting #LeaveTheScarfAtHome
Fri May 17 00:08:46 +0000 2019,"On my way home to NZ and heard the news that former Aussie PM, Bob Hawke, has passed away. I never had a chance to meet Bob, but it was easy to feel like you knew him. He was such a charismatic figure and one clearly driven by his love of people. Rest In Peace, Bob."
Fri Mar 15 03:33:42 +0000 2019,The person who has committed this violent act has no place here. To those in Christchurch; I encourage you to stay inside and follow the instructions of @nzpolice. The Police Commissioner will be making a public statement at 5pm. I will update everyone again later this evening.
Fri Mar 15 03:33:02 +0000 2019,What has happened in Christchurch is an extraordinary act of unprecedented violence. It has no place in New Zealand. Many of those affected will be members of our migrant communities – New Zealand is their home – they are us.
Tue Oct 30 02:43:53 +0000 2018,"To those who felt the quake - GNS have confirmed their assessment that it was M6.2 and 25km SW of Taumarunui. Widely felt across central NZ. Grabbing updates from officials but in the meantime, do check on those around you!"

Wed Sep 19 01:12:33 +0000 2018,@rihanna @GCMandela100 @GPforEducation @MFATgovtNZ @ClaraLionelFdn Absolutely agree – education investment is the key! Keen to see an increased focus on the Pacific (we just announced $9 million to support access to education in the Pacific last week).
