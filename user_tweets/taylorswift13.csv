Fri Jun 19 17:09:36 +0000 2020,Can’t wait to watch @Disclosure_Doc on @netflix today!! Executive produced by @Lavernecox who is extraordinary 💕💕💕 Who else is gonna watch?! https://t.co/tYnZXfYzk5
Fri Jun 19 04:01:22 +0000 2020,"For my family, everything that has transpired recently gives us an opportunity to reflect, listen, and reprogram any part of our lives that hasn’t been loudly and ferociously anti-racist, and to never let privilege lie dormant when it could be used to stand up for what’s right."
Fri Jun 19 04:01:22 +0000 2020,"Personally, I’ve made the decision to give all of my employees June 19th off in honor of Freedom Day from now on, and to continue to educate myself on the history that brought us to this present moment."
Fri Jun 19 04:01:21 +0000 2020,"Happy Juneteenth! I want to thank @TheRoot and @RhapsoDani for allowing me to post this video about the significance of today, June 19th, and why it should be celebrated as a National holiday. https://t.co/7yjwh4Lddg"
Mon Jun 15 17:24:59 +0000 2020,"YES!! Thank you to the Supreme Court Justices who voted in favor and all the advocates who have fought so hard for this! We still have a long way to go to reach equality, but this is a beautiful step forward. 🌈❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🌈 https://t.co/zTd3i5P2TL"
Fri Jun 12 20:07:58 +0000 2020,"When you fight to honor racists, you show black Tennesseans and all of their allies where you stand, and you continue this cycle of hurt. You can’t change history, but you can change this. 🙏"
Fri Jun 12 20:07:58 +0000 2020,I’m asking the Capitol Commission and the Tennessee Historical Commission to please consider the implications of how hurtful it would be to continue fighting for these monuments.
Fri Jun 12 20:07:57 +0000 2020,We need to retroactively change the status of people who perpetuated hideous patterns of racism from ‘heroes’ to ‘villains.’ And villains don’t deserve statues.
Fri Jun 12 20:07:57 +0000 2020,"Taking down statues isn’t going to fix centuries of systemic oppression, violence and hatred that black people have had to endure but it might bring us one small step closer to making ALL Tennesseans and visitors to our state feel safe - not just the white ones."
Fri Jun 12 20:07:57 +0000 2020,"His statue is still standing and July 13th is ‘Nathan Bedford Forrest Day.’ Due to social pressure, the state is trying to overrule this, and Tennesseans might no longer have to stomach it. Fingers crossed."
Fri Jun 12 20:07:57 +0000 2020,"Then we get to this monstrosity. Nathan Bedford Forrest was a brutal slave trader and the first grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan who, during the Civil War, massacred dozens of black Union soldiers in Memphis. https://t.co/n2DiEt9F3P"
Fri Jun 12 20:07:56 +0000 2020,Replacing his statue is a waste of state funds and a waste of an opportunity to do the right thing.
Fri Jun 12 20:07:56 +0000 2020,"FYI, he was a white supremacist newspaper editor who published pro-lynching editorials and incited the arson of the office of Ida B. Wells (who actually deserves a hero’s statue for her pioneering work in journalism and civil rights)."
Fri Jun 12 20:07:54 +0000 2020,Edward Carmack’s statue was sitting in the state Capitol until it was torn down last week in the protests. The state of Tennessee has vowed to replace it.
Fri Jun 12 20:07:54 +0000 2020,"As a Tennessean, it makes me sick that there are monuments standing in our state that celebrate racist historical figures who did evil things. Edward Carmack and Nathan Bedford Forrest were DESPICABLE figures in our state history and should be treated as such."
Tue Jun 09 19:09:57 +0000 2020,We need to fight for mail-in voting for the 2020 election. No one should have to choose between their health and having their voice heard. https://t.co/4ImsKW1fQN
Tue Jun 09 19:09:57 +0000 2020,This article written by @BarackObama is a fascinating read about changing policy at the state and local levels. https://t.co/kwwFjaXCuC
Tue Jun 09 19:09:56 +0000 2020,"Racial injustice has been ingrained deeply into local and state governments, and changes MUST be made there. In order for policies to change, we need to elect people who will fight against police brutality and racism of any kind. #BlackLivesMatter"
Fri May 29 15:33:41 +0000 2020,"After stoking the fires of white supremacy and racism your entire presidency, you have the nerve to feign moral superiority before threatening violence? ‘When the looting starts the shooting starts’??? We will vote you out in November. @realdonaldtrump"
