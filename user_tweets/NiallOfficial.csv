If you start a song on acoustic guitar and it sounds sad, you also then have the option dress it up however you want production wise after.

Mon Jan 13 08:24:32 +0000 2020,@itsfIicker I choose guitars based on the different sound it gives off . So this one is amazing when it’s set to ‘clean’ for songs like ‘TMTA’  and ‘ on the loose’ for example. Other guitars are better for a more distorted sound and work well with different pedals. All very geeky stuff

Sun Dec 08 10:02:11 +0000 2019,I’m not talking about any artist in particular. I’m talking about the culture on here of just abusing people because you can. It’s not like you would walk down the street screaming out loud about the people you dislike a small bit.
Sun Dec 08 09:51:25 +0000 2019,@imanarrystan I’m not talking about me coz frankly I don’t give a shite about that stuff coz I’ve better things to be worrying about but..... some of the abuse I see artists getting on here is shocking .
Sun Dec 08 09:29:02 +0000 2019,"I see a lot of abuse aimed at artists online. Why can’t everyone just concentrate on the artists they like and if you don’t have anything nice to say about artists you may not like , well just keep your mouth shut 🤐"

Sun Nov 24 10:22:55 +0000 2019,"@flickersmartina @shesfireaway It’s not just as simple as finish the song “ here ya go Spotify, Apple etc, put that on your playlist” . I wish it was as simple as that but they also need time to work on their end ."
Sun Nov 24 10:21:55 +0000 2019,"@flickersmartina @shesfireaway Mixing takes a while. the smallest things make such a big difference . Then it goes to mastering which is quite fast. Then it needs to get to the hands of people at the label and onto different people who provide music , they need time then put their plan together ."

Sun Nov 24 10:15:49 +0000 2019,@shesfireaway I like this question.  It’s basically all the levels of each instrument / sounds on each song. Maybe I want to turn the guitar up in a certain area or turn a part of a harmony up or....... very random stuff but it’s the way I hear certain things
